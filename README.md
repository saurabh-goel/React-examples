# About

Latest version of Node


This project is a simple app that changes the color of a div upon click.

The purpose of this repository is to understand the data flow in applications using React and Redux.

The code in all of the files has been annotated, and there are pretty console logs (in Google Chrome at least) that document the data flow path.

#Steps

#Steps - 1 
# Install all the dependencies
npm install  


#Steps - 2
# Run the application
npm start

Here's a custom diagram I made as well:
